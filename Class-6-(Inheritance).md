### Class 6 Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. Inheritance is a topic that can seem very intuitive to some and very confusing to others. Be mindful of this gap and encourage discussion in pairs as short lecture activities to help students hear other perspectives on why programmers use inheritance.
1. The exercises for today and the studio require someone to diagram their classes. By now, all of the students should be used to this, but now that they have learned more about the pillars of OOP, they should be following object-oriented principles. This would be a good time to go over a class diagram and talk about why you made the decisions you made.
