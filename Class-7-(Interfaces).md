### Class 7 Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. Polymorphism has a deceptively simple definition, but can be difficult to grasp. Have students share what polymorphism is to them and share examples to drive home this particular pillar of OOP.
1. Interfaces may not seem to serve much of a purpose to some. Go over some sample code or class diagram and explain why those behaviors were assigned to an interface. To drive it home, share what behaviors might go in an abstract class.

## Small Group Time: Class 6 Studio (TF Notes)
1. This studio requires use of given interfaces in Java. Encourage students who are confused to checkout the documentation linked in the book for further explanation of how these things work!
