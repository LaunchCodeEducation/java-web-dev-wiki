## Large Group Time (Instructor)

### Lesson 20 Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. Review the characteristics of REST. REST is deceptively simple, but so important for the students to understand!
1. Go over the Adopt-a-Pet examples! Highlight the URL portions of the URLs for different pet searches.
1. Make sure to leave time to do a temperature check for the previous lesson. Did everyone finish the studio? Is everyone getting the concepts? Class 19 had a lot of material in it.

## Small Group Time: Lesson 20 Studio (TA Notes)

1. Make sure to get every student through the authentication studio! By the end of the class, everyone should have a fully-functioning web application with authentication!
1. If students have completed all that they need to complete for the authentication studio, encourage them to review REST and authentication with their classmates. Can they find another site that has an easy-to-read URL and identify the final portions?
1. While everyone should be learning and finishing up their work, there is no harm in a little fun! If you want to do something special for your group, check in with your Course Manager to make sure it is okay!
