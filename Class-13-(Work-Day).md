# Class 13: Work Day

The students have no prep work for this class and no new material will be introduced. Today's class is designed to be an in-person working day. 

TAs should address this with their students before today's class and discuss individualized prep work plans for their students. Work with your students to develop a set of goals to accomplish during the work day. Perhaps some students will take the time to complete outstanding assignments and come to class with questions that are blocking any 
further progress. For students who are up-to-date with assignments, you may offer other studying resources or encourage them to use
the in-class time to work on prep work for the next lesson. 

There is no need for large-group time and lead instructors need not prepare a formal lecture. That said, if there are any topics you
wish to cover or re-address briefly, now would be an opportunity to do so. You may want to ask students to send you questions ahead of 
class and you can address FAQs at this time. Keep in mind that today's class time is meant to be spent coding so encourage students to 
stay and use the class time appropriately. 

Most of class time will be spent in small groups organized by what areas the students are working on, rather than the typical TA sections. As always, check with the course manager for announcements.
