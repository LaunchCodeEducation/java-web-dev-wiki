### Class 16 Topics That Require Careful Attention

1. Review the relationship between Java classes/objects and database tables/rows.

   1. Creating a new schema and add a new user in MySQL Workbench.
   1. Add the necessary dependencies in IntelliJ.
   1. Add the user info for the schema in MySQL into ``application.properties``.

## Small Group Time: Class 16 Studio (TA Notes)

1. If students didn't finish the exercises, they can check out the ``add-persistent-category`` branch of their ``coding-events`` repo. If they do not have that branch in their repository, they need to fetch from the upstream and merge into their repository.
   1. To do so, they need to make sure the upstream is set up with ``git remote -v`` and double check that they are on ``master``.
   1. With the upstream present, run ``git fetch upstream``
   1. Then merge the upstream into the forked repo with ``git merge upstream/master``.
1. An ``AbstractEntity`` is a new concept. This is a good chance to share some examples of why you, as a developer, may use an ``AbstractEntity`` in your work.
1. Check in with your students!
